JPSegment
This is the main code for recompiling MIPs code. It performs SEDiagram construction and reduction. It also removes operations on transient memory. Note that there's an error in JPLWInst.cpp because it doesn't handle stack pointers. I'll try to fix it.

SPIM MIPs Simulator
This is the SPIM simulator that takes in MIPs code and outputs a trace. To get it to output the trace, you'll need a command line argument but I'm not sure of the exact character. It has been modified to handle memory and free. Thus the heap is a colllection of memory regions that can merge together.

C to MIPs Compiler
This is a C to MIPS compiler that I used. The code needs to be written such that the variables are assigned to registers instead of the stack.

Memory Model for Spim
This is the memory model that was put into SPIM. It handles memory as a collection of allocated regions. If two regions are together then they are adjacent.
